		Public speaking is one of the skills which the students need to develop, and one of the fun ways to improve it is through debate. The Debate Society UPNVJT accommodates the students who want to develop their argumentative skills as well as their English public speaking skills. Not only that, the society also prepares its members to participate in national and international-level competitions such as the National University Debating Competition (NUDC) and the United Asian Debating Competition (UADC). In this extracurricular activity, the member students can engage in regular trainings facilitated by experienced coaches and get immersed with the latest international issues.

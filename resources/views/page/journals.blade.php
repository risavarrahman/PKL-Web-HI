			WIMAYA is an international scholarly journal devoted to international affairs. Published twice a year by the International Relations Department, Pembangunan Nasional Veteran East Java University, the journal aims to promote the importance of interdisciplinary approach to analyze various international issues. The journal welcomes empirical and theoretical research articles that seek to cut across disciplines in order to capture the complexity of a phenomenon. Regardless the topic or methodology, the primary focus must be international affairs. We particularly encourage research articles that tackles global-local dynamics. The editors also welcome discursive book reviews that contribute to the literature.
